## Bio
I am a software developer for <img src="https://rlabs-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/rlabs.png" width="30" alt="Movement Labs" />[Movement Labs](https://movementlabs.com) and a masters student in data science at the UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. I hold a bachelor's degree in Economics from Reed College, where I studied environmental and natural resource economics with a focus on climate change.

I believe we need powerful social movements to win transformative environmental legislation. I worked for 4 years as a community organizer building power for economic and environmental justice in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Once the pandemic hit and much community organizing work transitioned online, I worked with Movement Labs to help send 50 million voter registration and turnout texts in the lead up to the 2020 election. I learned that tech tools can support the frontline organizers who are building people power. Now I build automations & data pipelines for progressive political organizations to help them get more done, work smarter, and make better use of their data.
