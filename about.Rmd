I am a software developer for Movement Labs and a data science student at the UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. I hold a bachelors degree in Economics from Reed College, where I studied environmental and natural resource economics with a focus on climate change.

I believe we need powerful social movements to win transformative environmental legislation. I worked for 4 years as a community organizer building power for economic and environmental justice in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Once the pandemic hit, I worked online with Movement Labs to help send 50 million voter registration and turnout texts in the lead up to the 2020 election. I learned that tech tools can support building people power. Now I build automations & data pipelines for progressive political organizations to work smarter and get more done.
