  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>In my <a href="https://austinweisgrau.github.io/migrating-to-prefect-part-1-civis-woes.html">previous blog post</a>, I explained the limitations with Civis
as a production tool for a data/engineering team. These limitations
led our data team at Working Families Party to choose to move our
orchestration tooling off of Civis and into another tool. After
evaluating a few tools, we were excited to begin our migration to&nbsp;Prefect.</em></p>
<p>This post will explain how we set up Prefect and some of the choices
we made along the way. You can follow along with the full set up as a
template repository <a href="https://github.com/austinweisgrau/prefect-ecs-template">here</a>.</p>
<p>First, just one vocabulary word that will make the rest of this post
more&nbsp;readable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prefect &#8220;Flow&#8221;: this is more generically called a script or data
  pipeline. Prefect is fundamentally about the orchestration,
  execution, and observability of&nbsp;flows.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Orchestration and Execution in&nbsp;Prefect</h2>
<p>Orchestration tools handle the separation of orchestration and
execution differently. Some tools, like Civis and Airflow, handle both
of these in the same layer. The same platform that schedules and
triggers workflows is also responsible for executing them, often in
the same compute&nbsp;environment.</p>
<p>Prefect handles this differently and fully separates the
orchestration and compute layers. The orchestration layer is run in a
cloud server instance running an <span class="caps">API</span>-first web application with a <span class="caps">UI</span> for
viewing and interacting with Prefect assets. Prefect offers a managed,
hosted version of the server called the Prefect Cloud, with a
generous free tier. (More documentation about Prefect&#8217;s design <a href="https://www.prefect.io/why-prefect/hybrid-model/">here</a>).</p>
<p>The Prefect execution layer happens separately, and there is currently
no managed option (although one is slated for release in the coming
months). A Prefect &#8220;agent&#8221; or &#8220;worker&#8221; is a program that runs in
the execution environment, frequently polls the Prefect orchestration
server, and executes any flows that have been triggered by the
server. Prefect users are responsible for setting up the environment
for a Prefect agent or worker to&nbsp;run.</p>
<h2>Cloud execution&nbsp;options</h2>
<p>While it is possible to run Prefect flows locally, for example on the
laptops of your team&#8217;s staff, a more robust solution is to run a
Prefect agent in a cloud computing environment. There are many
different ways to accomplish&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>A common method is to use cloud &#8220;serverless&#8221; compute infrastructure to
run the Prefect agent. Some popular options include <span class="caps">AWS</span> <span class="caps">EC2</span>, <span class="caps">AWS</span> <span class="caps">ECS</span>,
Azure Container Apps, or Google Cloud&nbsp;Run.</p>
<p>Some organizations with more resources might even choose to run their
execution layer in a cloud-hosted Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes is
very configurable and scalable, but has a steeper and more complicated
learning&nbsp;curve.</p>
<h2>Tutorials and&nbsp;templates</h2>
<p>One of the limitations of using Prefect is that the tool is newer,
the community is smaller, and there are not as many resources
available yet (compared to more mature tools like Airflow)
demonstrating how to accomplish various set-ups. However, there are a
few excellent templates and tutorials for getting the Prefect execution
layer set up in various cloud&nbsp;environments.</p>
<p>We used the &#8220;dataflow-ops&#8221; <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/prefect-aws-ecs-fargate-github-actions-make-serverless-dataflows-as-easy-as-py-f6025335effc">tutorial</a> and <a href="https://github.com/anna-geller/dataflow-ops">template</a> to get our set up
started in <span class="caps">AWS</span> <span class="caps">ECS</span>. We chose to use <span class="caps">AWS</span> <span class="caps">ECS</span> largely because we use <span class="caps">AWS</span>
Redshift and <span class="caps">AWS</span> S3 as our primary database and data storage layers,
and there are significant performance benefits to using <span class="caps">AWS</span> services&nbsp;together.</p>
<p>Alternatively, <a href="https://medium.com/@nwosupaul141/serverless-deployment-of-a-prefect-data-pipeline-on-google-cloud-run-8c48765f2480">this tutorial</a> looks useful for getting started in Google
Cloud Run. We may switch to this implementation if we end up moving
off of Redshift and into Google Biguery at some&nbsp;point.</p>
<h2>Needing a dedicated <span class="caps">IP</span> for access to&nbsp;redshift</h2>
<p>The Movement Cooperative (<span class="caps">TMC</span>) is a cooperatively run organization
that supports progressive organizations run their tech stacks. <span class="caps">TMC</span>
manages our organization&#8217;s data warehouse in&nbsp;Redshift.</p>
<p>We needed to enable a dedicated <span class="caps">IP</span> address for our execution
layer so that we could have our <span class="caps">IP</span> address whitelisted by <span class="caps">TMC</span> in order
to access the Redshift instance. Setting up a dedicated <span class="caps">IP</span> address for
an <span class="caps">ECS</span> Task involved an understanding of some networking concepts and
tools in <span class="caps">AWS</span>. Some new vocab words for me: &#8220;<span class="caps">VPC</span>&#8221;, &#8220;subnet&#8221;, &#8220;<span class="caps">NAT</span>&nbsp;gateway&#8221;.</p>
<p>The dataflow-ops template included an <a href="https://github.com/anna-geller/dataflow-ops/blob/main/infrastructure/ecs_cluster_prefect_agent.yml"><span class="caps">AWS</span> CloudFormation Script</a> for
setting up the <span class="caps">ECS</span> Task and its networking infrastructure. I modified
that script using <a href="https://gist.github.com/jbesw/f9401b4c52a7446ef1bb71ceea8cc3e8">this template</a> to enable the use of an &#8220;elastic <span class="caps">IP</span>&#8221;
address in <span class="caps">AWS</span> for our <span class="caps">ECS</span> tasks. I also needed to modify&nbsp;the
<code>prefect_aws.ECSTask</code> block stored in our Prefect Cloud instance to
always use the correct (private) <span class="caps">VPC</span> subnets (see our <a href="https://github.com/austinweisgrau/prefect-ecs-template/blob/main/infrastructure/ecs_cluster_prefect_agent.yml">full configuration script for CloudFormation here</a>). </p>
<h2>Deploying&nbsp;Changes</h2>
<p>There are two different ways a Prefect flow can be deployed which
determine how the code is passed to the Prefect agent and&nbsp;executed.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Prefect agent and/or ECSTask can run on a docker image that
   contains the flow&nbsp;code</li>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.prefect.io/concepts/deployments/#deployment-build-options">flow deployment can be built</a> with a <a href="https://docs.prefect.io/concepts/deployments/#block-identifiers">cloud &#8220;storage block&#8221;</a> (for
   example, S3), where the flow code will be uploaded on deployment
   and downloaded when the flow is triggered by the agent to&nbsp;run.</li>
</ol>
<p>When changes are made to flow code, the updates can be pushed into
production either by recreating and reuploading the docker image
(strategy 1), or by rebuilding the flow deployment using a storage
block (strategy 2), which uploads the new code to the storage&nbsp;block.</p>
<p>I found the docker strategy to be somewhat simpler, so I modified the
Github Actions deployment script included in the <a href="https://github.com/anna-geller/dataflow-ops/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yaml">dataflow-ops template</a>
to rebuild and reupload the docker image anytime the code is
updated. Our flow deployments do not include a storage&nbsp;block.</p>
<p>See our <a href="https://github.com/austinweisgrau/Prefect-ecs-template/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yaml">deployment Github Actions script here</a>.</p>
