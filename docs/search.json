I hold a bachelor’s degree in Economics from Reed College, where I studied environmental and natural resource economics with a focus on climate change.\n            I believe we need powerful social movements to win transformative environmental legislation. I worked for 4 years as a community organizer building power for economic and environmental justice in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n            Once the pandemic hit and much community organizing work transitioned online, I worked with Movement Labs to help send 50 million voter registration and turnout texts in the lead up to the 2020 election. I learned that tech tools can support the frontline organizers who are building people power. Now I build automations & data pipelines for progressive political organizations to help them get more done, work smarter, and make better use of their data.\n            \n            \n            Education\n            UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science & Management | Santa Barbara, CA     M.A. Environmental Data Science, Expected June 2022\n            Reed College | Portland, OR     B.A. Economics, 2015\n            \n            \n            Experience\n            Movement Labs | Tech & Operations Associate | July 2020 - Present\n            Jewish Youth for Community Action | Program Coordinator | September 2018 - February 2020\n            Service Employees International Union, Local #1021 | Organizer | October 2016 - August 2018\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n              Austin Weisgrau\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                                    \n                    \n                      LinkedIn\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      GitHub\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      Email\n                    \n                  \n                                  \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              Bio\n              I am a software developer for Movement Labs and a data science student at the UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science & Management.
