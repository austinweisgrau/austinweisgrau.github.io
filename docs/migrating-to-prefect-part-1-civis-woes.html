  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This is the first post in a series of blog posts about our migration
to Prefect at Working Families Party. I&#8217;ll start by describing our
current orchestration and execution platform, Civis, and its many&nbsp;limitations.</em></p>
<p>In a data context, &#8220;orchestration&#8221; refers to the work of coordinating,
scheduling, and automating the movement and transformation of data
from its raw sources to everywhere it is needed in an
organization. This work is often conceptualized in terms of a series
of &#8220;data pipelines&#8221;, which extract data from sources, load it to
destinations, and transform it along the&nbsp;way.</p>
<p><a href="https://civisanalytics.com">Civis</a> is a widely used orchestration platform across the progressive
political space. Civis is an afforadable and accessible platform for
writing and running <span class="caps">SQL</span> and python in a cloud&nbsp;environment.</p>
<p>Civis is an all-inclusive data platform that allows campaigns and
organizations to manipulate data in their Redshift warehouse, automate
<span class="caps">SQL</span> and Python jobs, run scripts on containers, and more. They also
have an intuitive <span class="caps">SQL</span> to G Sheet export functionality that tend be the
bread and butter for a lot of political organizing. Civis is very user
friendly and does not require any engineering or &#8220;devops&#8221; experience
to get up and running. Civis has a lot going for it and there are good
reasons it is&nbsp;popular.</p>
<p>However, Civis is not an appropriate production tool for mature data
or engineering teams. Civis has many limitations, and many of its
design choices in favor of ease-of-use end up as liabilities in the
long term. For any team that is regularly running <span class="caps">SQL</span> and python
scripts with nontrivial logic, it is important to explore issues with
Civis as a production&nbsp;tool. </p>
<h2>Version&nbsp;control</h2>
<p>Version control is a critical tool for engineering at
every level. It enables collaboration, oversight, institutional
memory, an additional form of documentation, and more. There are tons
of resources online expounding the benefits and necessities of version&nbsp;control.</p>
<p>Using Civis as a production environment severely limits the extent to
which version controlling is possible. This problem alone is
significant enough to make Civis a bad choice, even if there were no
other&nbsp;issues. </p>
<p>Scripts that are stored in Civis are not version controlled. It is
possible to exclusively use Civis container scripts to run scripts
that are version controlled through Civis. But even in that scenario,
none of the configuration parameters, automated scheduling, workflow
dependencies, or credentials are version&nbsp;controlled. </p>
<p>Much more common is to have a large proliferation of production and
development scripts stored, shared and run exclusively in&nbsp;Civis.</p>
<p>As an example to demonstrate why this is problematic, imagine
that a team member accidentally deletes a single character from a <span class="caps">SQL</span>
script while they are reading the script one day, causing the output
of the <span class="caps">SQL</span> script to change slightly in a problematic way that isn&#8217;t
obvious. Next week, another team notices that there are issues in a
database table that didn&#8217;t previously exist. Your job is to determine
why this table isn&#8217;t populating correctly, even though officially no
one has touched any of the relevant code in many&nbsp;months.</p>
<p>If the pipeline is complicated in any way, you will have to pull up
each individual script in Civis and check to see if the file was
updated recently. You find that this <span class="caps">SQL</span> script was updated last week,
but you can&#8217;t see what the change was. You have to parse and test the
entire <span class="caps">SQL</span> script manually to determine why the results aren&#8217;t correct,
and invent a new solution that hopefully restores the original intended&nbsp;behavior. </p>
<p>If version control was in place, your first step would be to check the
logs, and see that a small change was made last week that wasn&#8217;t
intended, and to revert the change. More realistically, the change
would never have been made, because your team member would have had to
commit the change, issue a <span class="caps">PR</span>, have the <span class="caps">PR</span> approved, and merge the
change before it showed up in the production environment at&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>There are many, many other scenarios where version control is a
critical element of keeping a team functioning in the long&nbsp;term.</p>
<h2>Environment&nbsp;variables</h2>
<p>A Civis container can run a python script fetched from a github repo
on a Docker container of your choosing. A common pattern for fetching
credentials in python is to fetch them from environment variables
that aren&#8217;t directly stored in the code. Environment variables can be
set in Civis container scripts as &#8220;Parameters.&#8221; Parameters can be set
to credentials that are saved separately at a User level in&nbsp;Civis.</p>
<p>Credentials saved in Civis can <span class="caps">ONLY</span> be made availabe in the
environment using a <code>_USERNAME</code> and <code>_PASSWORD</code> suffix. That is, if
your credential is named <code>SLACK_API_KEY</code>, Civis forces you to make
secret values available in the environment using keys
<code>SLACK_API_KEY_USERNAME</code> and <code>SLACK_API_KEY_PASSWORD</code>. This choice clearly
doesn&#8217;t always make sense and requires a workaround for every
credential that does not fit this&nbsp;pattern.</p>
<p>Setting up civis scripts with parameters and credentials is a somewhat
tedious manual process. The Civis <span class="caps">API</span> does make some, but not all, of
this process&nbsp;scriptable.</p>
<h2>Programmatic configuration of&nbsp;orchestration</h2>
<p>Often data pipelines will have some non-trivial logic for how and when
different steps should be triggered, which steps are dependent on
others to complete first, etc. It is possible to set up these kinds of
dependencies and automated scheduling in Civis using the web
app. Automated scheduling is also possible to set up using the <span class="caps">API</span>,
however as far as I can tell, it is not possible programmatically
configure dependent workflows outside of the <span class="caps">GUI</span>.</p>
<p>Orchestration logic reflects important technical and business
considerations and should not be exclusively configured in a
web app. Having a web-app-first or web-app-exclusive interface for
configuring orchestration means that changes to the configuration
can happen without anyone noticing, and reverting changes can be
difficult. Orchestration logic should be explicitly configured in the
same version-controlled code repository that the code itself lives&nbsp;in.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Civis is a tool designed for ease of use. It abstracts away most of
the data engineering otherwise required for analytics work so that
data teams can get up and running quickly and easily with minimal
technical hurdles. This is essential for small, short-lived,
fast-moving campaigns common across the political&nbsp;space.</p>
<p>This design comes with a fatal flaw, which is that technical staff
using Civis ultimately are &#8220;protected&#8221; from ever needing to learn data
engineering practices. Data staff in the progressive political space
can go years, from team to team, working exclusively in Civis and
never learn data engineering best practices or even fundamental data
engineering concepts. Ultimately, the technical capacity of the
progressive movement depends on technical staff working closer to and
more directly with their data&nbsp;infrastructure.</p></div>
