title: (Data) Engineering Resources
date: 2023-02-07

Here is a collection of resources that I've found useful in my
development as a data engineer. I'll add to this page over time.

# Books

### [Data Pipelines Pocket Reference, Densmore](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-pipelines-pocket/9781492087823/)

The best reference book I've come across for the full picture of the modern data engineering toolkit and workflow. Has lots of useful example code.

### [Refactoring, Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html)

This book completely transformed my relationship to legacy code, and data engineers usually work with a lot of legacy code. If you can compose many trivial, behavior-preserving changes into coherently redesigned and simplified code, you will have no fear.

### [Python Data Science Handbook, VanderPlas](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)

I especially appreciated its first chapter about ipython.

# Articles

- [The Grug Brained Developer](https://grugbrain.dev/)

"learn from many, many mistake grug make over long program life"

- [How to Ask Questions the Smart Way](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)

Effective engineers are highly self-sufficient. You will answer 90% of your own questions before you have finished reformulating them as smart questions.
  
# Tutorials

- [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/)

This is where I started. I am a big fan of the "hard way" learning philosophy. The main idea is to never read about how to do something without actually doing it yourself as you read.

- [The Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)

This tutorial carried me through my first year of work. Not necessarily relevant for data engineering, but if you want to know how to throw together a web application in python, this tutorial is excellent.
