I am a data engineer on the Left. I am currently on staff at [Working Families Party](https://workingfamilies.org). I have also worked with [BlueLabs](https://bluelabs.com) and [Movement Labs](https://movementlabs.com).

I believe we need powerful social movements to win transformative social and environmental legislation. I worked for 4 years as a community organizer building power for economic and environmental justice in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Once the pandemic hit and much community organizing work transitioned online, I worked with Movement Labs to help send 50 million voter registration and turnout texts in the lead up to the 2020 election. I learned that tech tools can support the frontline organizers who are building people power. Now I build automations & data pipelines for progressive political organizations to help them get more done, work smarter, and make better use of their data.
